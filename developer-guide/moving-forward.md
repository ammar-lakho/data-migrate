# Moving Forward

Just like we deployed a ZRC-20 token contract, we can deploy a ZRC-721 NFT contract, which is a standard interface for non-fungible tokens, like a deed for artwork or a song.&#x20;

For more contract interfaces, you can use any of the [OpenZepellin](https://openzeppelin.com/contracts/) interfaces as Zenith is completely EVM compatible. Decentralized exchanges (like Uniswap and Pancakeswap), decentralized stablecoins (like DAI) and any smart contract application can also be deployed on Zenith using Remix, Truffle, Hardhat or any other EVM development environment.&#x20;

So let's come together and BUIDL on Zenith Chain.
