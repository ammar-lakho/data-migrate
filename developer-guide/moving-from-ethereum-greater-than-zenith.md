# Moving from Ethereum -> Zenith

The good news is that all the tooling you have used in the development of Ethereum, or any other EVM-based blockchain for that matter, will work seamlessly with Zenith Chain. You get the blazing fast speed of Zenith without needing to switch from your favourite development environment, be it truffle or hardhat. Wallets (like Metamask), will also work and you will not have any sort of learning curve to start developing on Zenith.&#x20;

Deploying an existing smart contract does not require any rewriting. If you deploy contracts using Truffle or Hardhat, you only need to change the RPC url to one of the [following](../rpc-endpoints.md). If you use Remix, here's a [guide](zen-20-contract-development.md) for you.

So come onboard and enjoy the best of worlds: the speed of Zenith Chain and the power of the EVM.
