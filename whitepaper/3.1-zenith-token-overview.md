# 3.1 Zenith Token Overview

Zenith Chain, after critically understanding the demands for tokens, studying the underlying token standards, and determining the acceptable features of our crypto coin, has decided to redesign the token as ZRC-20 and ZRC-721. The token is issued on the blockchain network that allows the token to exist autonomously with few restrictions on where it can be traded. Zenith Chain has its own protocol and token types which define how they function within the platform. The protocols include details such as how transactions are executed, how blocks are created and how consensus is reached. Different protocols such as Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) will also be discussed further in this post.&#x20;

The features we are searching for in our token will be:

1. Optimal Security: The security of the ZENITH Token will be from Ethereum or by a pool of professional validators.
2. It must be efficient and compatible but also have flexibility, adaptability, and ease of use.
3. The ZENITH Token must be customizable to fit with the requirements of investors.
4. Its sovereignty is inalienable.
