# 3.3 Zenith Chain Token Smart Contract

A smart contract is a digital contract, also referred to as self-executing contracts, between two parties using a decentralized ledger on the blockchain as a database. This contract may streamline the exchange of assets, documents, digital currencies or anything that can be valuable to the concerned parties. The ledger contains the terms of the digital contract and can also determine when the ‘digital conditions’ have been fulfilled. Smart Contracts are self-enforcing and usually self-verified according to the automated agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. The code which is the term of the agreement is contained within a decentralized blockchain network. Zenith Chain Smart Contracts cannot be changed once the code has been programmed.
