# 3.4 Benefits of the Zenith Chain Smart Contracts

The usersâ€™ Zenith Chain Smart Contracts enjoy the following services-

1. The Zenith Chain Smart Contracts get the same optimal security level as the Ethereum network, which is impressive.
2. The Zenith Chain network will still ensure that work in the smart contract is carried out as 24 determined in the terms.
3. The Zenith Chain Smart Contracts will enjoy the speed of block generation of the Ethereum network. This speed will shorten the time spent on transactions and other business processes.
4. The parties on the Zenith Chain Smart Contract will rest assured that the automated process of the smart contract will ensure that both parties will meet the terms and conditions without disputes.&#x20;
5. There is no need for a third party when the two parties use a Zenith Chain Smart Contract.
6. Smart contracts are encrypted and cryptography keeps all the documents safe from infiltration.
7. The Zenith Chain Smart Contract can always be accessed on the ledger and cannot be lost, stolen, or destroyed. However, Smart contracts alone cannot get information about "real-world" events because they can't send HTTP requests. This is by design. Relying on external information could jeopardize consensus, which is important for security and decentralization.
