# Introduction



Zenith Chain is an innovative solution to bring programmability and interoperability. Zenith Chain relies on a system of 83 validators with Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus that can support short block time and lower fees.\


The Zenith Chain also supports EVM-compatible smart contracts and protocols. Cross-chain transfer and other communication are possible due to native support of interoperability. The Zenith Chain will be:\


* A self-sovereign blockchain: Provides security and safety with elected validators.
* EVM-compatible: Supports all the existing Ethereum tooling along with faster finality and cheaper transaction fees.
* Interoperable: Comes with efficient native dual chain communication; Optimized for scaling high-performance dApps that require fast and smooth user experience.
* Distributed with on-chain governance: Proof of Staked Authority brings in decentralization and community participants. As the native token, ZC will serve as both the gas of smart contract execution and tokens for staking.
